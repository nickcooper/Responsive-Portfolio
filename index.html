            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I am a 36 year old web developer. I am originally from Iowa. I grew up in Mason City then have lived in Ames, Ankeny, Des Moines, and West Des Moines. I am currently living with my brother and sister-in-law while I go through this program and hope to find a job in the Denver area.</p>
                
            <p>I started web development back in high school around 2000-01 and was first exposed to HTML/CSS/Javascript before bootstrap, jquery, and other frameworks became popular. I got an AA degree in web design/development from NIACC (community college) then went to Iowa State University to persue graphic design. That didn't pan out so I looked of a web development job.</p>

            <p>I worked as a frontend developer for about 5 years before switching jobs to do backend development for about 5 years. I have been away from the frontend development for about 3-4 years and want to modernize my knowledge of the more current frameworks and technologies. I look forward to building newer web apps to solve business needs</p>
